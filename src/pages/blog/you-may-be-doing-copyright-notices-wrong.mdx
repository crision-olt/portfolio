Introduction

Copyright is a legal concept that provides creators with exclusive rights over their original works. On websites, copyright notices inform users that the content is protected and cannot be copied, distributed, or altered without permission. However, you might be using the wrong format for your copyright notice.

The Common Misconception

Many people believe that the standard copyright format should be: Copyright © [DATE]. [COMPANY]. However, this format can be misleading. The purpose of a copyright notice is to indicate the first date of publication for all content on the website, such as blogs, blurbs, and custom images. Consequently, the date should not be changed every year, as this would alter the "first publication" date.

The Correct Approach

Instead of using the standard format, consider the following alternative: Copyright © [START DATE] – [CURRENT DATE]. [COMPANY]. This format not only signifies the correct "first publication" date but also provides other benefits.

Benefits of Including a Start Date

By including a start date in your copyright notice, you can:

Demonstrate your company's experience and longevity, conveying trustworthiness to your audience
Facilitate tracking and protecting your intellectual property over time
Emphasize your commitment to providing up-to-date and relevant content
